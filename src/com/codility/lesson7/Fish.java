	 *  
	 * Problem facts:
	 * 1) two non-empty zero-indexed arrays A and B consisting of N integers.
	 * 2) Arrays A and B represent N voracious fish in a river, ordered downstream along the flow of the river.
	 * 3) The fish are numbered from 0 to N âˆ’ 1.
	 * 4) If P and Q are two fish and P < Q, then fish P is initially upstream of fish Q
	 * 5) Fish number P is represented by A[P] and B[P].
	 * 6) Array A contains the sizes of the fish. All its elements are unique.
	 * 7) Array B contains the directions of the fish. It contains only 0s(upstream) and/or 1s(downstream)
	 * 8) two fish P and Q meet each other when P < Q, B[P] = 1 and B[Q] = 0
	 * 		-If A[P] > A[Q] then P eats Q, and P will still be flowing downstream,
	 *      -If A[Q] > A[P] then Q eats P, and Q will still be flowing upstream.
	 * 9) N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
	 * 10) each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000,000];
	 * 11) each element of array B is an integer that can have one of the following values: 0, 1;
	 * 12) the elements of A are all distinct.
	 * 13) expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
	 * 14) expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) 
	 * 
	 * Solution:
	 * Mantain a stack of living fishes, living fishes are those that survives collisions (0,1), or flow in the 
	 * same direction of bigger fishes (0,0 - 1,1), or just never collide (1,0). 
	 * Two possible cases
	 * A) 0,1 (these is a collision)
	 * B) 0,0 - 1,0 - 1,1 (these are not collisions)
	 * 
	 * Why to use a stack? Because of the nature of the stack, it is a LIFO dynamic set (last in first out)
	 * I'll use the LIFO feature of the stack to keep track of the living fishes
	 * If there is a collision and the new fish is bigger, I'll continue popping out fishes until, either, the
	 * stack is empty or there's a bigger fish downstream.  
	 * 
	 * @param A
	 * @param B
	 * @return the number of fish that will stay alive.
